# Additional Charges May Apply

Mike jerked awake, abruptly exiting strange dreams. In his dream he was listening to music. He had skipped through a dozen songs before settling on one he liked. His instinct was to remain listening to the first, or maybe even turn the music off altogether. Music appreciation was nearly
at his luxury level. Skipping ahead was true luxury.

"Good Morning, Mike," said his phone. "Authorizing nocturnal royalties charge of 4,465 carbon credits. Would you like itemization?"

"Yes," said Mike.

"Sopranos episode reference, 700 carbon credits," said Mike's phone. "Empire Strikes Back _Hoth_ setting multi-sensory immersion experience, 1,700 carbon credits. 18 minutes 43 seconds music appreciation, various artists, 1,500 carbon credits. 8 minutes 9 seconds licensed color appreciation, PANTONE 144 C, 640 carbon credits, processing and disbursement fee, 15 carbon credits. Total: 4,465 carbon credits."

"Crikey," said Mike, being careful not to elaborate enough to incur copyright royalty charges. _I should probably buy a monthly pass or some heavier duty sleeping pills_, he thought to himself. Mike went about his morning business (10 carbon credits plumbing fixture activation fees, 45 carbon credit sewage processing fee) and then sauntered downstairs (5 carbon credit  handrail rental fee) for breakfast.

"Instant Plex, what's for breakfast today?" Mike said.

"Oatmeal today, Mike," said the Instant Plex. "100 carbon credit release fee." That included acquisition, cooking, and timed delivery. Mike wasn't hungry enough to authorize Instant Plex to release his breakfast. "Would you like to proceed?" asked Instant Plex.

"Scrap it, Plex," said Mike. Instant Plex's vaporization mode was certified 100% safe to humans, but Mike still closed his eyes every time. "5 carbon credit disposal fee, Mike," said Instant Plex, "5 carbon credit voice interaction fee. 10 carbon credits total."

"Good morning to you, too, Plex," said Mike. He sat down on his kitchen bench, avoiding the cushioned side and its 5 carbon credit supplemental comfort fee. He'd still get billed for base bench usage.

It was summer. The sun was up. The blinds were open. The lights were on, wastefully accruing  usage charges. "Lights out," Mike said. 

"I'm sorry, Mike," said Mike's phone. "Insufficient funds in your distribution account to toggle lighting. I can transfer carbon credits from your accumulation account. Would you like to proceed?"

Nobody could spend directly from their accumulation account. Carbon credits had to be transferred out to a distribution account before they could be spent. For a fee. Life wasn't set up for consumer convenience.

"Yes," said Mike. "Transfer 100,000 carbon credits."

"I'm sorry, Mike," said the phone. "Insufficient funds in your distribution account to cover transfer fee. You can borrow 10 carbon credits to cover the transfer fee, at a 1:10 borrowing rate. Would you like to proceed?"

"Yes," said Mike.

"Transactions complete," said the phone. "Loan repaid. Lights deactivated. Current distribution account balance: 99,880 carbon credits."

Some days every molehill felt like a mountain. Mike's phone was a lousy conversation partner, but leaving home was just... too complicated. He didn't need to work, nobody did. He didn't have much business outside his apartment. Government carbon credit allowance meant everyone could remain fed, entertained, and healthy without leaving home. But every day was pretty much the same. He'd seen everything and done everything that anyone could do at home.

"What's the latest Recycling Package?" Mike asked.

"Your age group is eligible for Recycling. Volunteers will incur 14,500 carbon debits for standard cancelation, disposal, and processing fees," said the phone. "Incentives totaling 18,000 carbon credits will be deposited to volunteer's accumulation account, to be dispersed to designated beneficiary."

"Huh," said Mike.

"Would you like to proceed?" asked Mike's phone.
