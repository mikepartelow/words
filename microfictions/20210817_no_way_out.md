# No Way Out

I was already having a lousy day when I lost all my words. At breakfast I had to eat mashed up cereal crumbs because that's all I had left. It's technically still cereal. Then, just moments ago, I fell off the observation deck of the Space Needle. And now I've lost all my words.

No doubt you wonder how I can write this while accelerating towards the earth having lost all my words. That's not important right now. What's important is that without words, apparently, time halts.

Here I am suspended halfway between the inimitable view from the Space Needle observation deck and certain death, entirely bereft of the capacity to describe my situation to myself. Sure, I can tell you all about it, but I suspect you're fictional.

Without description, I cannot conceptualize my plunge. Without conceptualization, I cannot experience my plunge. And without experience, what's left? So here I am, floating, with no way to go. I would much prefer to go back up, but I suspect that is not really on offer this afternoon.

I am trapped in this moment with no way out, at least until my power of conceptualization returns. Given the circumstances, I think that may be for the best.

After all, tomorrow morning I am completely out of breakfast cereal.
