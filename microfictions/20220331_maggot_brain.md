# Maggot Brain

Ei subvocalized the incantation one final time before closing the Circle in the sand. Confident in her memorization of every syllable and inflection, she closed the Circle and her eyes. Standing tall in the center of her Summoning Circle, she chanted loud in her Power Voice.

"...mecka chiney ho!" she announced, completing the incantation. Chill infused the cave. The candle flames turned to ice, crackling, radiating a weird, unflickering pale blue glow. A presence stirred beside her.

"You have summoned the Demon Wanting! What is your Demand?"

Ei deferred her surprise. She had prepared a Demand, carefully phrased to resist malicious compliance. Demons delighted in ironic wish fulfillment. Sorcerers, less so.

"I Demand to rise above it all," said Ei, "before I drown in my own shit."

"Very well," said Wanting. The cave, the darkness, and the chill dissolved. Ei found herself reclining on a cloud, bathed in gently warming sunlight, the world so far below that she could not distinguish anything smaller than a mountain. She sensed the presence of people, so far away, but she could not see them or their fields, cities and roads.

Perched upon her cloud, warm, alone, and untouchable, Ei exhaled deeply. All tension in her body and mind and dropped away, effortlessly. She hosted no further anguish to release. Here she was, above it all.

"What else, then?" said Wanting, manifesting from nothing just over Ei's shoulder, uninvited. Startled, Ei offered no response. Wanting shrugged and peered over the edge of the cloud, imperiously inspecting the world below. His body slithered around in front of Ei, then his head followed. He peered into Ei's eyes.

"Well?", said Wanting.

"Nothing else," said Ei. "You are dismissed. The Spell is complete, the Circle is no more, the Demand is granted. Begone."

Wanting's chuckle escalated slowly into thunderous guffaws. "Oh, no, dear Sorcerer, that is not how it works. You have risen above it all, but no-one rises alone. I sustain you at this height. Without me, you will sink all the way back down to where you began. You must choose."

Ei fell silent.

"Take your time," said Wanting. "There's plenty of room on this cloud." 

There wasn't. 

Wanting continued, "I'll just wait over here while you think upon your next Demand."

Ei closed her eyes, sighed heavily, and nodded once. The warmth evaporated from her skin. For an instant, she felt intensely dizzy.

Ei opened her eyes, and found herself back in the cave. The cave's mouth, a kilometer distant, beyond countless twists, turns, and treacherous forks, provided no light. The darkness was impenetrable.

Ei inhaled through her mouth. She tasted the shape of the cave and the contours of its topography. Ei set off, cautiously, through the maze of darkness, back out into the world.
