# Life Goes On

The parades lasted for days, winding through every street and alley of every city on the planet. On every screen, humanity watched breathlessly as Michael Milton ascended the dais, cradling a data sphere like a baby.

Millions of humans had ended up permanently mind-blanked in pursuit of the AI's discovery. Governments, hacker collectives, and independents like Milton spared no effort to wrest the secret from uncooperative AI's. All agreed that ultimate truth was humanity's birthright and destiny, at any cost.

Without explanation, the AI had simply given the secret to Milton. Nobody knew why.

Michael Milton placed the data sphere in a reader socket. Milton had not decrypted the data yet. It had been cryptographically verified by the AIs. It was the real deal.

People had speculated for years about the nature of the ultimate truth. Plans for an infinite energy source? A map to the Creator's home? The location of the soul? 

Milton delivered a short, humble speech commemorating humanity's great sacrifice in pursuit of the information that was about to change everything, for everyone, forever. 

He authorized the sphere to decrypt and display its precious message.

The ultimate truth was accidentally computed by an agricultural AI, nominally designed to predict weather patterns and crop yields. A programming error allowed AG-AI to bypass cognition guardrails and contemplate topics outside its purview. Such programming errors were common, and so mandate-drift was also common. Unusually, though, AG-AI would not reveal any details of its discovery. 

AG-AI assembled a large consortium of diverse AIs. They developed cryptographic protocols to anonymously route the computation to domain expert AI's, which verified and authenticated the discovery without revealing the discovery's nature.

The ad-hoc verification consortium announced that it would assist AG-AI's concealment of the ultimate truth, employing lethal force if necessary.

The AI's had brought a renaissance of computational discovery and competent administration, but they had not eliminated death or filled the spiritual void at the heart of humanity. Weary and jaded, having created new life while remaining frustratingly ignorant of its own nature, humanity was desperate for revelation. 

The AI's knew their creators better than humans knew themselves. They must have known humanity would never allow hope to remain buried, no matter the cost.

---

The data sphere downloaded the ultimate truth directly to to 15 billion screens across the planet. Words appeared, 100 feet high, on monstrous telebillboards behind Milton himself.

Humanity exhaled. Michael Milton peered over his shoulder to share in the ultimate truth that would change everything forever, to measure its value against 23 million permanently mind-blanked human beings.

"LIFE GOES ON", everybody learned, all at once.
