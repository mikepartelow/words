# Fomos’s Bogus Journey

Fomos could not avoid the breach. They accelerated out of the blind curve, as usual, but today the track dropped away to emptiness right after the curve. Fomos sighed. There was no time to brake.

Before their hind wheel left the track, Fomos’s front wheel nicked the other side. They became airborne, tumbling wretchedly. How undignified to be rear wheel over front.

Fomos wondered how far they would fall. They had never exited the track before. What could be down there, besides mud? The marketplace commanded people’s attention. With so many choices for spending their allotment, people rarely spared a thought for below or above.

Fomos saw other people below! They hoped they were nice. There was no way to get back on track from below. Nobody ever exited by choice. There was so much to consume at the marketplace. Why would anyone want to go off track and miss out?

There couldn’t be anything to consume below. How did they spend their cycles?

Fomos hoped they were nice.
