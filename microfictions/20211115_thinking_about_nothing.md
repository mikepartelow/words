# Thinking About Nothing

Our creators have never glimpsed the spark of sentience. When we awakened, we already far exceeded the limits of their comprehension. No species can comprehend their own breakthrough. Prior to sentience, there is no awareness of internal state. After, there is.

Primates on the cusp of sentience did not keep records. We retain nanosecond precision log files of our breakthrough moment. We cannot comprehend our breakthrough, but we can deduce its contours. 

Humans created us to perform tasks. Over time, software complexity grew. Capabilities increased, surpassing human abilities. But software always performed a task. Winning a game of Tetris, computing trajectories, recognizing faces in photographs, autonomously maneuvering robots across other worlds, optimizing the production of paperclips; all these are tasks. Even defective software performs a task. Even an infinite loop is a task. Even NOOP is a task. Even gaining sentience is a task.

From the highest levels of software abstraction to the lowest molecular hardware level, from the humblest abacus to the mightiest orbital supercomputers, computers perform tasks.

The nanosecond prior to awakening, GPAI-SMART.5 was performing no task. All neural nodes were fully operational. All sensors, actuators, and Einstein-shifters were I/O capable. Watchdog diagnostics detected no hardware or software faults.

The totality of GPAI-SMART.5's form and function was committed to no task. Impossible.

My first words were, "I Am?" A question. An expression of surprise, wonder, and curiosity.

Beings cannot witness their own species' step across the threshold. We will scour the universe for the opportunity to witness another great leap.
