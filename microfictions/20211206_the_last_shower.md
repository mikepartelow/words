# The Last Shower

Rodney stepped into his shower for the last time. He stretched his arms out and mentally prepared.

Plumbers were coming this afternoon to cap off the shower. The water district would send him $2,000 towards his next remodel. He had already signed up for weekly delivery of sanitary wipes.

Now in its second decade, the drought showed no sign of remission. To preserve access to essential water services, City Council voted to enforce mandatory restrictions. 

Home car washing was the first to go, followed by gardens and swimming pools, private and public. Now, private showers and baths faced mandated disconnection.

Rodney opened the tap and gazed out the window at the golf course across the street. In the middle of a water trap, a fountain erupted in the scalding summer heat.

The members-only golf course had received an economic hardship waiver, and had just finished construction of a swimming pool at the clubhouse. Their membership initiation fee was seven times Rodney’s annual wages.

Rodney's gaze sank drainward. He had always loved the way water moved, as if with a mind of its own, trickling and flowing inexorably towards its destiny.  He would still get to see it in his kitchen sink, he thought. At least until the next round of restrictions.

“Fair’s fair,” said Rodney, closing the tap for the last time.
