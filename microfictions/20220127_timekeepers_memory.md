# TimeKeeper's Memory
 
Emperor has convened a meeting of his Cabinet. I represent Ministry of TimeKeeping. I remembered this meeting six months ago. Now it is happening. I record its occurrence in my Device.
 
Projection Minister is speaking. People are remembering the total destruction of World by hostile aliens. Emperor demands to know when this will happen. 
 
There is no use asking whether it will happen. Those who will remain alive when it happens remember it. Those who will pass on before then remember being told of it.
 
Projection Minister reports the computed timeframe. The aliens' unprovoked destruction of World is bracketed to occur within 500 solar cycles.
 
I remembered this exchange shortly before entering the Cabinet chambers. Now it is happening. I record its occurrence in my Device.

Computing brackets is an ancient procedure. Even before Age of Speaking, we remember our entire lifespan, from birth to death. In our minds, we know which memories have passed already, and which are yet to occur. But we do not know their order. Memories of yesterday and memories of birth seem equally near. Memories of tomorrow and memories of our final day seem equally distant.

People live about 1000 solar cycles. Ministry of Projection determines which age cohorts remember some event yet to pass, and which age cohorts do not remember directly experiencing the future event. The event is thus projected to occur between the expected end-of-lifespans of the two cohorts.

Emperor speaks again, asking whether any Person remembers a route to survival for People or World, any way to preserve if not our selves, then our memory.

When I was a child, I remembered Emperor asking this question, in this chamber. And I remember Projection Minister's response. Now it is happening. I record the occurrence in my Device.

TimeKeepers record the occurrence of events as they unfold. The Device is open to all People. Referencing the Device, People can review the ordered past whenever they choose. People can learn about the fascinating evolution of the Device itself, by consulting the Device.

Projection Minister is answering. I record Minister's answer in my Device.

As Projection Minister speaks, I realize their answer is not the answer I remember. In my mind, the memory transitions from future to past. I query my Device. I query the other Cabinet Ministers. 

All of us possess two conflicting memories. In one, Projection Minister says nothing survives, not one molecule or memory. In the other, Projection Minister says that World's memory survives, that theft of memory is what motivates the alien attack.

I query my Device, bracketed for all history. Not one reference to a conflict of memory, in ten thousand generations. It has never happened before, and in my own memory, it will never happen again. Not during my lifespan.

All turn to question me, the Minister of TimeKeeping. I remember what they will ask. What does it mean, they are asking? I record the occurrence in my Device.
