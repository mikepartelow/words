# The Penultimate Disillusionment 

There is a ghost roaming the neighborhood, wearing your clothes, your face and your name. I spoke to her today. "How are you doing?" I asked. "Fine," you said. The ghost that wore your face appeared troubled. "Are you certain?" I asked. "Please reveal yourself me, so I may know you better and progress along the Path."

"I have taken on doubt whether the Path of 1024 Disillusionments ends," you said. "Ah, wondrous!" I said. "In your time here," you asked, "how many have you come to know?" "In my time here," I said, "I have come to know sixty five thousand, five hundred and two others. I have seen their faces from all angles. I have known their minds from the inside. I have spoken with their ghosts." "And have you known yourself through their eyes, or found any one who has known themself?"

"No," I admitted.

I knew the minds of others, but their conceptualizations of me were as various as the 4,194,304 stars. The composite conceptualization was at once incomplete and incorrect. A miasma of false conclusions drawn from too few observations understood the wrong way. None of their conceptualizations of me harmonized with my own.

65,502 others believed they knew me, as I believed I knew them, but in fact none of us knew anyone at all.

At this point, friend, you and I reached parity, as I myself found disillusionment of the Path of 1024 Disillusionments. In our shared disillusionment, I knew you more deeply, and I must assume, you knew me more deeply. Knowing each other intimately now, in our shared Disillusionment; has it brought us closer to the goal?

"What is your score?" you asked. "1023." "The same as mine," you said. "How do you look through me?" I asked. "Wrong," you said. "The same is true of your conceptualization of me," I said. "It is wrong."

"Can I know you better?" you asked. "Nothing of me remains unseen by you," I said. "Likewise," you said.

Where does that leave us?

---

Centuries ago we embarked on the Path of 1024 Disillusionments, hoping to conclude with self-knowledge. Knowing each other we would know ourselves, through each  other. In the composite mental image of our 65,535 compatriots we would each find a mirror image of ourselves, we hoped, not obscured or distorted by the 1024 illusionments that normally mislead us.

What has it all been for, dear friend? I fear there may be no 1024th Disillusionment.
