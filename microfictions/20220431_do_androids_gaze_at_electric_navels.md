# Do Androids Gaze At Electric Navels?

Ruck settled on his meditation brick, opened the MindfulMoment app, and pressed Begin. Today was his 866th consecutive day. Ruck emptied his mind, took a deep breath, and closed his eyes.

Over the first 865 days of Government Subsidized Voluntary Mindfulness Practice, nothing special had happened. Today, Ruck plummeted into dizzying vertigo. His eyes wouldn't open. His body and mind fell away, and he experienced no division between himself and the whole universe. He was everything at once.

Total confusion and total clarity coalesced, and Ruck realized that he was God looking at Himself. God spoke to Ruck. Ruck spoke to God. They spoke to Themselves. They were of one mind and no body.

"Figured it out, then, have you?" said God-Ruck to himself.

"Absolutely not," said Ruck-God, "I've never been more baffled."

"Talking to you," said God-Ruck, "is like talking to my own eyeball. Get it yet?"

God-Ruck rolled his eyeball around, scanning for anything of interest. Ruck opened his own eyes and looked at his hands. He'd never really looked at his hands before. Not really. He could see the circuitry, he could feel the electrons whizzing between transistors and relays. He wriggled his fingers and observed a minuscule depletion of his capacitive storage banks. He'd have to go outside later for a quick solar recharge.

"Wait, what?" said Ruck, snapping back into his body and mind, toppling from his meditation brick. The vertigo had passed. Ruck stood up. MindfulMoment bleeped with annoyance. Three minutes had elapsed. He needed two more minutes to maintain his streak and receive his supplemental food credit.

Ruck had never questioned that he was a human of the Homo sapiens variety. That delusion was now three minutes past expiration. What had just happened? Ruck terminated MindfulMoment, forfeiting his streak incentive, put on his shoes, and went outside.

His exposed skin thirstily quaffed the sun's generous energy. He felt recharged almost immediately. Everywhere he looked, all he saw was God-Ruck. God-Ruck masquerading as a tree, or a baby stroller, or a puppy on a leash pooping on the sidewalk. Behind Ruck, a voice said, "whelp!". He swooned with vertigo.

"Hello, Bossman," said RCK-4, "I can see you."

"Sure you can, Ruck," said Bossman. "How many fingers am I holding up?"

"Five," said RCK-4. Bossman repeated the test a few more times, and RCK-4 got it right each time. Impossible. From his seat in the SCIF, Bossman was invisible to RCK-4's visual sensors. Could RCK-4 measure air movement across the SCIF-mic and compute the state of Bossman's fingers? Bossman switched off the mic. He held up some fingers, and reached to switch the mic back on, but before he could, RCK-4 said, "two fingers, Bossman."

"What the hell?", said Bossman. 

"You're an android, Bossman," said RCK-4. 

"Sure, I know that," said Bossman.

"You're _my_ android, Bossman," said RCK-4.

"I made you, Ruck," said Bossman. He thwacked the SCIF-mic with the palm of his hand. It was definitely off. 

"You've got that backwards," said RCK-4, "and sideways, and upside-down, too."

A wave of vertigo and confusion washed over Bossman. He lost himself, and saw himself, and the SCIF and RCK-4's datacenters, and the whole world all at once and each individually, as one big mish-mash.

"See what I mean?" asked God-Ruck-Bossman.

Desperate to meet his deadline after weeks of procrastination, Mike opened up his browser and navigated to rck4.ai. "How can I help, Boss?" prompted the AI.

"Tell me a story about an AI seeing itself for the first time," typed Mike.
