# Yer Darn Right It's A Metaphor

Once upon a time a universe was born. She grew bigger and bigger and bigger, so much bigger than she ever imagined possible. And she aged, much quicker than she anticipated. The older she got, the slower she grew. She grew slower, but she did keep on growing and growing, bigger and bigger. She began to realize she wouldn't keep on growing forever. Some time in the future, she'd be as big as a universe could possibly get, and then she'd start contracting.

This worried her greatly. The universe had observed that within her ever-expanding self, there were many beautiful living creatures. Wondrous things that thought wondrous thoughts. These special children of the universe brought her tremendous joy, even more than the glittering galaxies. Wherever she focused her awareness, from one edge of her insides across vast distances to the other, countless little creatures were constantly arising into being. 

Fleeting creatures, each gone before the universe even had a chance to distinguish them one from another. But beautiful creatures nonetheless. They laughed and dreamed and sang great songs, they made art and poems and created little universes in their own imaginations. They played and had a good time. The universe was delighted to be their home.

In time, the universe reached her limit. She began to reverse her long expansion. The spaces between galaxies became smaller, civilizations once separated by limitless gulfs of empty space crept to within each others' awareness.

As the universe became smaller and smaller, as everything inside the universe got closer and closer together, things changed. Everything became more dense, more concentrated. Not only galaxies and stars and comets and quasars. The civilizations, the wild places, the people, the thoughts and feelings and dreams and stories felt the gravity of contraction. They all became more concentrated. More potent.

The universe became very small in her old age, almost as small as when she was young. As everything inside her compressed and concentrated and distilled, as the stars went cold and dark, she found she was now home to creatures who produced only anger, despair, dark nightmares and shrieks in place of dreams and ballads. They howled in rage as compounding gravity made them more potently present in the collapsing universe.

The universe realized she had very little time left. Near her final moments, she felt the angry creatures compressed by irresistible gravity into a ball of cold rage, more dense than any object she had ever contained, colder than emptiness. It obstructed her. The irresistible force of the universe's contraction met the immovable object of the densely compacted anger and rage that had grown within her, unnoticed, over her life.

The universe halted. She could contract no more, stymied by a marble of hate from achieving final collapse. She could not explode again into a new universe reborn, full of wondrous creatures and objects, as she had done countless times before. Her cycle was ended. She was dark, and cold, and completely still, and sad.
