# The Parable of Mike's Mirror

The electrician who fixed the wiring in my bathroom installed a powerful exhaust fan. It is not the prettiest but he assured me it is among the most powerful on the market. Odors found no safe haven in my bathroom. And the bathroom mirror resisted fogging no matter how hot or long my showers.

I grew my hair out. It fell below my shoulders and required attentive grooming after every shower.

After a while, the layout of the bathroom changed, reducing the effectiveness of the exhaust fan. The mirror fogged up during nearly ever shower. 

I found a chemical agent to apply to the mirror that reduced  but did not eliminate fogging. It left a waxy residue on the mirror - probably by design - which meant image distortion when the bathroom wasn't full of steam. After cleaning the mirror, as one does, I had to reapply the anti-fog agent.

Something needed to change. I couldn't see my luxurious mane for its necessary post-wash grooming.

So I shaved off all my hair. Now I don't need to see myself at all after showering. Problem solved. 

Also, I now save thousands[^Off by 3 orders of magnitude, but the idea of saving tens of dollars isn't funny.] of dollars a month on shampoo, and I can take a full wet-head shower right before bed. I can shower and go right outside when it's below freezing. I don't have to remember where I left the blow drier. I'm not even sure if I own one. I have started collecting fashionable hats. My scalp makes a calming sound when I rub  it. Scritsch, scritsch, scritschhhhhhhhh.

## Takeaways

- We can often sidestep a problem without addressing it head-on[^Get it?], particularly if we are willing to let go of some thing(s).
- Unanticipated side effects (massive shampoo cost savings) can end up being more impactful than intended effects (fog-agnostic mirror).
- Don't believe everything you read.
